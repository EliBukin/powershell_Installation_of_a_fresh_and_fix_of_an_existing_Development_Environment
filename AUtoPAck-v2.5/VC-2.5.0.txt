Version 2.5.0:

Install process:

1. Now the script is compatible with WIN10 and spaiens setup that store user profile under ONEDRIVE.
	Conditional statements were added, and assigned to variables.
	
2. From "ELMago.bat" removed the "noexit" flag, the initial cmd terminal closes automatically.

3. Execution policy is enabled through the script.

4. Rearanged the $path variable to fit a specific path like "$JBpath"

5. The PS script starts as NOT elevated, it elevates itself if required.
	Here's how it works:
     The first line checks to see if the script is already running in an elevated environment. This would occur if PowerShell is running as Administrator or UAC is disabled. If it is, the script will continue to run normally in that process.
     The second line checks to see if the Windows operating system build number is 6000 (Windows Vista) or greater. Earlier builds did not support Run As elevation.
     The third line retrieves the command line used to run the original script, including any arguments.
     Finally, the fourth line starts a new elevated PowerShell process where the script runs again. Once the script terminates, the elevated PowerShell window closes.
	 
Uninstall Process:

1. From "ELMago.bat" removed the "noexit" flag, the initial cmd terminal closes automatically.
